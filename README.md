This repository demonstrates a common error in R when dealing with missing values (NA) and provides a solution.  The `bug.R` file showcases the incorrect approach, which leads to unexpected NA values in the results.  The correct approach, avoiding this pitfall, is presented in `bugSolution.R`.  The issue arises when performing arithmetic operations directly on vectors containing NA values, leading to propagation of NA throughout the result.
